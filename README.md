## How stuff is organized
Within the src (source) folder you'll find three individual folders:

* src
	* js (contains required javascript)
	* css (contains styling)
	* tables (contains json files of data)
	
To add a new table this must be defined in index.html

## Requirements
The calculator can only be used with newer browser, with javascript enabled. Browsers like IE6 may work, but is not supported.

Also, the code must run from a server in order to load the JSON files properly. This is due to the Javascript Origin Policy.
